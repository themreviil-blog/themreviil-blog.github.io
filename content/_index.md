# Hello friend,

Welcome to my blog! I’m Jakub Przepióra, though online, many people know me as TheMrEviil. I am the CEO of Nice Code sp. z o.o., where we specialize in developing websites, online stores, bots, and web systems. Occasionally, we take on penetration testing projects, though it's not our main focus.

After work, I dedicate much of my time to cybersecurity passion that brings a lot of excitement to my day. I’m particularly drawn to web security and regularly engage with labs like HackTheBox and TryHackMe to refine my skills. I’m also a CTF (Capture the Flag) player, which allows me to continuously train and explore new techniques. On this blog you can find stuff from cybersecurity, programming and maybe electronicts but in this I'm totalty beginner.
